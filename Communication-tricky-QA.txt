How would you convience your manager if you are transfered to a new location and you do not want to go?

I feel very happy to know that I have been transfered to new location. However, I have my personal commitments related to 
family which makes me difficult to relocate. I think I can support the team remotely if the management is ready to 
permit me to work from home.
